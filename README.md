This repository provides examples of Chisel code that exploit different software engineering paradigms/patterns.
To use this repository, install `sbt` and build the examples with `sbt run` to produce FIRRTL IR at various levels and Verilog.
Inspect the Chisel code that generated this in `src/main/paradigms/ALU.scala`.
